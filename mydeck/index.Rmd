## The Assignment:

We were instructed to do the following:

- Create a Shiny application
- Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
- Write a pitch and present it using Slidify

--- 

## My Data:

The data used in my application is taken from the following Kaggle page:

https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon

This data set includes 721 Pokemon, including their number, name, first and second type, and basic stats such as HP, Attack, Defense, etc.


--- 

## Data Exploration

```{r, echo=FALSE}
setwd('/users/Tom/Desktop/Data Science/Course9-DDP/mydeck')
PokeData <- read.csv("Pokemon.csv")
head(PokeData)

```

The data itself is complete, however several variables were removed (ID, name, is the pokemon considered legendary or not) were removed from the classification.

## The Application

My application can be found on:

https://tomsnir.shinyapps.io/Course9-DDP/

It performs K-mean Clustering, while allowing the user to pick the number of clusters, as well as the X and Y axis.
